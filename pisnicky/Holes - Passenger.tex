\[Em\hidx{7}]{I know} a \[D/F\shrp{}]{man with} \[G]nothing in his hands
\chordsoff
Nothing but a rolling stone
He told me 'bout when his house burnt down
And lost everything he owned
\fin

\num
He lay asleep for six whole weeks
They were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing he said a day is something
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose

Now I got a \[C]hole in my pocket, a \[G]hole in my shirt
A \[D]whole lot of troubles he \[Em]said
\chordsoff
But now the money is gone, life carries on
And I miss it like a hole in the head

I know a woman with kids around her ankles
And a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper
And the motherf*ker never came back
\fin
\num
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise
Keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked
So what you're gonna worry me for

Now he left a hole in my heart, a hole in a promise
A hole on the side of my bed
But now that he's gone, well, life carries on
And I miss him like a hole in the head

Well, \[C]sometimes you can't \[G]change and you can't \[D]choose
And \[C]sometimes it seems you \[G]gain less than you \[D]lose

Now we got \[Am]holes in our \[C]hearts
Yeah we got \[G]holes in our \[D]lives
Well we've got \[Am]holes, we've got \[C]holes but we carry \[G]{on }  \fadeout
