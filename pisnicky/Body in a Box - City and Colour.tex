There's a funeral procession on the highway
Traffic screeches to a halt
There's people searching for a better way
To live their lives
Johnny lived a good life, you'll hear them say
As tears of sadness soak the ground
The reaper crept in, took his breath away
In the middle of the night

\[Em]{We celebrate} the lives of the \[C]dead
It's like a man's best \[G]party, only happens when he \[D/F]dies
\[Em]{We gather} round to pay our res\[C]pects
While their \[G]souls are still searching for the \[D/F]light
Searching for the \[G]light

So please don't come to me on my dying day
Just let me go in peace
With all the things that I forgot to say
Still racing through my mind
And don't you bury me six feet under ground
Just burn my body in a box
And let my ashes blow with the wind
Out into the night sky
