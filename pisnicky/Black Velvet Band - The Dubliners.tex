In a \[G]neat little town \[C]they call \[G]Belfast
Apprentice to \[C]trade I was \[D]bound
\[G]Many an \[G/F\shrp]{hour sweet} \[Em]happiness
Have I \[C]spent in that \[D\hidx{7}]neat little \[G]town

A sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from my friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes they shone like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said was
Bad luck to the black velvet band

Before the judge and the jury
Next morning I had to appear
The judge he says to me~-- young man
Your case it is proven clear
We give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
For they feed you with strong drink, \uv{Oh yeah}
Till you are unable to stand
And the very next thing that you'll know is
You've landed in Van Diemen's Land
