But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are crying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie?

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

\freev
It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie?
