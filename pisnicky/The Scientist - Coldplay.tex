\[Em]Come up to \[C]meet you, tell you I'm \[G]sorry
You don't know how \[G\didx{sus2}]{lovely you} are
\chordsoff
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I'll set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh lets go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

\[C]Nobody said it was easy, \[G]it's such a shame for us to \[G\didx{sus2}]{part}
\[C]Nobody said it was easy
\[G]{No one} ever \[G\didx{sus2}]{said it} would be this \[D]hard \[D\didx{sus4}]
Oh, take me back to the s\[G]tart \[C] \[G]

I was just guessing numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Don't tell you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh what a rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy, oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
