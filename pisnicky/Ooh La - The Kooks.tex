In their eyes is the place that you finally discovered
That you love it here, you've got to stay
On the bottom of the rock, an island
On which you find you love it when you twitch
You felt that itch in you pettycoat
Your pretty pretty pettycoat
Then you smiled, he got wild
You didn't understand that there's money to be made
Beauty is a card that must get played

The world can be a very big place
So be yourself, don't get out of place
Love your man and love him twice
Go to Hollywood and pay the price
Oh, go to Hollywood
And don't be a star, it's such a drag
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
It's a hard life to live, so live it well
I'll be your friend and not in pretend
I know you girl
