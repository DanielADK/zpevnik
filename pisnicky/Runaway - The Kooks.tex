Girl, I want to be good to you
Never wanna do you no harm
Caught up in those fascinations
Coping with your alarms
Ignore life if you want to, babe
Do what you've got to do
I need some time in the countryside
I wanna feel so brand new

You make me run away, angel
You make me run away

I see your name on the walls again
I painted you on my toes
Celebrate to resuscitate
We'll drink to ourselves
You collect lovers like gemstones
You talk of them as your friends
Dangle me from your wristchain
Another one lost to the winds of change

Still I try to be good to you
You'll always be my friend
I've spent some time to define my mind
I want to be someone new

Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away
Yeah, we could run away, angel
Yeah, we could run away
Why don't we run away?
You make me run away, baby
I wanna run away
I wanna run away
