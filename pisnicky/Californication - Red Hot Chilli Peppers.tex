It's the edge of the world and all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East at least it settles in the final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away~-- it's Californication
\fin
\bverse
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn, hardcore soft porn

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquake sounds to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn, hardcore soft porn
