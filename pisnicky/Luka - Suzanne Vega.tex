\[G]{My name} is \[D]Luka         \[C]
I live on the \[D]second floor      \[G]
I live up\[D]stairs from you       \[C]
Yes I think \[D]you've seen me before      \[Em]

If you hear \[D]something late at night \[Em]
Some kind of \[D]trouble, some kind of \[C]fight
\reppart{Just don't \[D]ask me what it \[C]was}
Just don't ask \[D]{me what} it was

I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

They only hit you until you cry
And after that you don't ask why

Yes I think I'm OK
I walked into the door again
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway
\fin

I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
