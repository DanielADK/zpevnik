Sometimes when I think of your name and it's only a game
And I need you
Listening to the words that you say, it's getting harder to stay
When I see you

This is gonna take a long time and I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand it's just the touch of your hand
Behind the closed door
