She's coming in twelve thirty flight, the moonlit wings
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies

Hurry, boy, it's \[G]waiting there for you \[Hm]

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that I've become
