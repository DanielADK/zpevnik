Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it no I'm not gonna smoke it till we're
Staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinkling in the silvery night

Two sips of whiskey in my flask but
I'm not gonna drink it I swear I'll make it last till we're
Drinking out of the same glass again

\[F]And though the \[C]sun may be washed by the \[G]sea
And the old will be lost in the \[F]new
Well, \[C]four will not wait for \[G]three
For \[G]three never waited for \[F]two
And \[C]though you will not wait for \[G]me
I'll wait for \[Am]you \[F]  \[C]
\[G]I'll wait for \[Am]you \[F]  \[C]  \[G]

A Polaroid picture in my wallet
I'm not gonna tear it no I'm not gonna spoil it
It's an unspoken heartbreak, a heartbroken handshake
I take with me where I go

\num
Three words on the tip of my tongue
Not to be spoken nor sung or whispered to anyone till I'm
Screaming at the top of my lungs again
