Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for
Does it take your breath away

Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins
