It's been a long day living with this
It's been a long time since I felt so sick
I took a long walk straight back home
I could've walked back to San Francisco
\fin\num
I used to long for time alone
I used to long for a place of my own
And I'm losing faith in everything
I'm lost, so lost, I'm lost at sea, you see

I used to long for broken bones
I used to long for a casket to call my own
I never had a problem facing fear
But I'm done, over and done my dear
