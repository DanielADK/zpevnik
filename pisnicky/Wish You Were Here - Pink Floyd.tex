\[C]So, so you think you can \[D]tell
Heaven from \[Am]hell, blue skies from \[G]pain
Can you tell a green \[D]field from a cold steel \[C]rail
A smile from a \[Am]veil
Do you think you can \[G]tell?

And did they get you to \[C]trade your heroes for \[D]ghosts
Hot ashes for \[Am]trees, hot air for a \[G]cool breeze
Cold comfort for \[D]change
And did you ex\[C]change a walk on part in the \[Am]war
For a lead role in a \[G]cage

\[C]How I wish~-- how I wish you were \[D]here
We're just \[Am]{two lost} souls swimming in a fish bowl
\[G]Year after year
\[D]Running over the same old ground~-- what \[C]have we found?
The same old \[Am]fears~-- wish you were \[G]here!
