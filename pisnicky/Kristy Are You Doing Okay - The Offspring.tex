There's a \[C]moment in time and it's \[F]stuck in my mind
\[F]Way back when \[G]{we were} just kids

'Cause your eyes told the tale of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did

\[F]Oh, waves of \[G]time seem to \[C]wash away the \[Am]scenes of our \[G]crimes
For \[F]you, this never \[G]ends

Can you \[C]stay strong, can you \[Am]{go on}

A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Though the marks on your dress have been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I shoulda spoke out and I'm so sorry now
I didn't know, 'cause we were so young

Oh, clouds of time seem to rain on innocence left behind
And never goes away
