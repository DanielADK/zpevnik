Way \[C]out in \[F]London \[C]airport in \[F]hangar number \[C]four
A \[C]lonely little \[Am]biplane lived whose \[Dm]name was Ever\[G]more
His \[C]working \[F]days were \[C]over, \[F]{no more} would he \[C]sail
U\[F]pon his wings a\[C]bove the clouds fly\[G]ing the royal \[C]mail

\[C]Bye-bye, biplane, \[F]once-upon-a-\[C]sky plane
\[F]Bye-bye, \[C]hush-a-bye, \[G]lullaby \[C]plane

All the mighty jet planes would look down their nose
They'd laugh and say~-- oh I'm so glad that I'm not one of those
And Evermore would shake away the teardrops from his wings
And dream of days when he again could do heroic things

Then one day the fog and rain had closed the airport down
And all the mighty jet planes were helpless on the ground
When a call came to the airport for a mercy flight
'Twould be too late, they could not wait, someone must fly tonight

And they rolled the little biplane out to runway number five
And though he looked so small and weak he knew he could survive
And as he rose into the storm the big jets hung their wings
And they hoped someday like Evermore to do heroic things

And so, my baby, bundle, I have spun a tale for you
You must learn there's nothing in this world that you can't do
Do not be discouraged by circumstance and size
Remember Evermore and set your sights upon the skies
