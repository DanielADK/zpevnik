\[C]How many \[F]roads must a \[C]man walk down
Before you \[F]call him a \[G]man
Yes and \[C]how many \[F]seas must the w\[C]hite dove \[Am]sail
Be\[C]fore she \[F]sleeps in the \[G]sand
Yes and \[C]how many \[F]times must the \[C]cannonballs fly
Before they are \[F]forever \[G]banned

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea
Yes and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free
Yes and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see

\num
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died
