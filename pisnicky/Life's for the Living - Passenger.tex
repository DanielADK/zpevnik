Well \[Em]grey clouds wrapped round the \[C]town like elastic
\[D]Cars stood like toys made of \[G]Taiwanese \[D]plastic
The \[Em]{boy laughed} at the spastic \[C]dancing round in the \[D]rain
\chordsoff
While laundrettes clean clothes high heels rub toes
Puddles splashed huddles of bus top crows
Dressed in their suits and their boots they all looked the same

I \[C]took myself down to the \[D]caf√© to find all
The \[G]boys lost in \[D]books and \[Em]crackling \[D]vinyl
And \[C]carved out a poem a\[D]bove the urinal that \[G]read

\chor
Don't you cry for the lost, smile for the living
Get what you need and give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it, or you're better off dead

Well the evening pulled the moon out of its package
The stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket
We needed a nail but we tacked it till it fell off the wall
While pigeons peg drains sparks flew like planes
The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
We all had new iPhones but no one had no one to call

Took myself down to the stomach of the town
Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown
With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said

I'm sick of this town, this blind man's forage
They take the dreams down and stick them in storage
And you can have 'em back son
when you've paid off your mortgage and loans
To hell with this place, I'm going my way
I'll stick out my thumb and trudge down the highway
Someday someone will be going my way home
\fin
\bridge
Till then I'll make my bed from a disused car
With a matress of leaves and a blanket of stars
And I stitched the words into my heart with a needle and thread
