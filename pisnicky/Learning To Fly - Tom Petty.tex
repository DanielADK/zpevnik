Well I \[F\didx{add9}]started \[C\hidx{+}]out \[Am\hidx{7}]\[G\didx{add11}] down a \[F\didx{add9}]dirty \[C\hidx{+}]road \[Am\hidx{7}] \[G\didx{add11}]

Started out all alone
And the sun went down, as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

\freev
Well the good old days~-- may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out, for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there
\cl
\freev
I'm learning to fly~-- around the clouds
But what goes up must come down
\cl
\freev
I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
