\[Am]What have I be\[F]come, \[C]{my sweetest} \[G]friend
\[Am]Everyone I \[F]know goes a\[C]way in the \[G]end
And \[Am]{you could} have it \[F]all, \[C]{my empire} of \[G]dirt
\[Am]{I will} let you \[F]down, \[G]{I will} make you \[Am]hurt

I wear this crown of thorns, upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts, I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time, the feeling disappears
You are someone else, I am still right here
