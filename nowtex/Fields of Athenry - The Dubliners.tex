By the \[G]lonely prison wall, I \[C]heard a young girl \[G]cal\[D]ling
\[G]Michael they have \[C]taken you \[D]away
\[G]For you stole trevelin's \[C]corn
so the \[G]young might see the \[D]morn
\[D]{A prison} ship lies waiting in the \[G]bay

\[G]Low \[C]lie \[G]the fields of \[Em]Athenry
Where \[G]once we watched the small free birds \[D]fly
Our \[G]love was the \[C]wing
We had \[G]dreams and songs to \[D]sing
It's so lonely round the \[D\hidx{7}]fields of \[G]Athenry

By the lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
Against the famine and the crown
I fought, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity

\num
By the lonely harbor wall
She watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
For she lived to hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
And it's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
