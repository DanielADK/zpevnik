\averse
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
\cl
\averse
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

\[Am]{But you} \[G]didn't have to \[F]cut me \[G]off
\[Am]Make out \[G]like it never \[F]happened and that \[G]{we were} no\[Am]thing
And \[G]{I don't} even \[F]need your \[G]love
But you \[Am]treat me like a \[G]stranger and that \[F]feels so \[G]rough
\chordsoff
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

\[Am]{Now and} \[G]then I think of all the \[Am]times you \[G]screwed me \[Am]over \[G]
\[Am]{But had} me be\[G]lieving it was \[F]always something \[G]that I'd \[Am]done \[G]
\[F]And \[Am]{I don't} wanna \[G]live that way, \[F]reading \[Am]into every \[G]word you say
\chordsoff
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
