You're just a stone's throw from me
But throwing stones could never be
The perfect way to start
'Cause sticks and stones make broken bones
Empty words make broken homes
But it's love that broke our hearts

\[Am]{If I} knew what you were \[G]thin\[D]king
\[Am]{I would} stop this boat from \[G]sin\[D]king
\[Am]{But darling} \[C]you are like the \[G]sand
And you're \[D]slipping through my \[Am]hands
I just \[C]don't know what you're \[G]thinking

You're just a photo in a drawer
But photographs are not much more
Than ghosts we can't forget
You're just a red rag to a bull
Just a false hope for a fool
But it's as close as I can get

Setting when my evening comes\ldots{}

\[Am]{And I} will stop the sky from \[Em]falling
If I \[G]knew, if I \[D]knew
\[Am]{And I} will love you every \[Em]morning
If I \[G]knew, if I \[D]knew
