Some \[Am]things in life are \[D]bad they can \[G]really make you \[Em]mad
\[Am]Other things just \[D]make you swear and \[G]curse
When you've \[Am]chewing an life's \[D]gristle
Don't \[G]grumble~-- give a \[Em]whistle!
And \[Am]this'll help things turn out for the \[D\hidx{7}]best

If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you've feeling in the dumps~-- don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin, give the audience a grin
Enjoy it~-- it's your last chance anyhow

So always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a pice if shit when you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show, keep'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
