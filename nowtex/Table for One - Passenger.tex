\[G]I'm not \[C\didx{add9}]{drunk, I} just \[G]miss being young

My wife she breaks and she bends
And my children they don't understand
I came here tonight in search of a friend
But I'm the invisible man

'Cause I've \[C]swallowed my tongue and I've polished my gun
And I've \[G]sat on my secrets for years
With my \[C]stiff upper lip my composure won't slip
And I've \[D]hidden each silent salty tear

I sit on this table for one
And I have been here before
It's a little less than I'd had in mind
But I wouldn't ask for more

And my mother she taught me to write
And my father he taught me his trade
And I wish that they could both be here tonight
To see what a mess I've made

My sons and my daughters don't know me at all
I've dug in trenches and put up walls
I whisper I love you each night as they sleep but
No one hears me when I speak from this table for one
\cl
\num
So I sit on this table for one
I won't go till they tell me to leave
Why did they teach me to follow my dreams
When dreams are all they can be?
