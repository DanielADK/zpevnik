I \[G]heard there was a \[Em]secret chord
That \[G]David played and it \[Em]pleased the Lord
But \[C]you don't really \[D]care for music, \[G]do \[D]you?
It \[G]goes like this
The \[C]fourth, the \[D]fifth
The \[Em]minor fall, the \[C]major \[D]lift
The baffled king com\[Hm]posing Halle\[Em]lujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrough you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on a marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really not going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember when I moved in you
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
And all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
