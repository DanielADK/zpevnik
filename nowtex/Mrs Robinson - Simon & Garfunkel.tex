Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' afair
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
Any way you look at it you lose

Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
