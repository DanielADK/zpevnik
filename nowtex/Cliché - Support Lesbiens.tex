This is \[G]waterfall of \[Em\hidx{7}]human tales

Just a piece of good luck is all that we claim
But I'm told by a friend it's more than sure
Just as clear as the sky, there is no fortune for all
\chordson
And this is \[C\hidx{maj7}]nobody's fault
And this is \[A\didx{sus2}]nobody's share~-- and I say:

\[G]Somebody's \[Em\hidx{7}]soaked, \[C\hidx{maj7}]somebody's \[A\didx{sus2}]cliché
Am \[G]{I caught} in the \[Em\hidx{7}]storm, \[C\hidx{maj7}]{the sleeping} \[A\didx{sus2}]creature
For I \[G]beg high and \[A\didx{sus2}]{hope, for} I \[G]beg high and \[A\didx{sus2}]{hold}
Till I \[G]fall in the \[C\hidx{maj7}]storm

This is whore that prays in church, torn her soul
This is countess on the ball, but the title is stolen
This is a cripple from the war, the guy you know
But the answer's in the end, something cannot be changed
And this is nobody's fault
And this is nobody's share~-- and I say:

\[G]Somebody, \[Em\hidx{7}]everybody, \[G]high or low or \[Em\hidx{7}]hiding
\[G]Nobody's born as a \[A\didx{sus2}]creature
\[G]You better be \[Em\hidx{7}]{not mad} at me
\[C\hidx{maj7}]{'Cause body} falls, \[A\didx{sus2}]vanishes souls~-- me better fear
\[G]Nobody's born as a \[A\didx{sus2}]creature
Nobody's \[C\hidx{maj7}]creature and \[A\didx{sus2}]{nobody fears}
