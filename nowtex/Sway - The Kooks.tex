Say whatever you have to say, I stand by you
Do whatever you have to do to get it out and not become
A reactionary to hurt the ones you love
\chordson
I know you never \[Em]meant to but you \[Bm]did \[D]
Oh yeah, you \[G]did \[Em]
\fin
\num
Be whoever you have to be, I won't judge you
And sing whenever you have to sing to get it out and not become
A recluse about your house, come out
I know you never meant to but you did
Oh but you did

Still I need your \[Bm]sway 'cause you \[D]always \[G]pay for it
\chordsoff
And I, and I need your soul 'cause you're always soulful
And I, and I need your heart
'Cause you're always in the right places

Take whatever you have to take, you know I love you
And come how ever you have to come to get it out, and get it out
\chordson
\[Bm]T-t-t-t-t-take it out on \[D]me, take it out on \[G]me
I'll give it you all, I'll give it \[Em]{you all,} I'll give it!
\[Bm]I'll give it you all, I'll \[D]give it you all
\[G]Yes I will give it you all
