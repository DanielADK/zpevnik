\[C]It's a little bit \[F\hidx{maj7}]{funny, this} \[G/B]feeling in\[Em]side
\[Am]{I'm not} one of \[Am/G]{those who} can \[Am/F\shrp{}]easily \[F]hide
\[C]{I don't} have much \[G]money, but, \[E]boy if I \[Am]did
\[C]I'd buy a big \[Dm\hidx{7}]house where \[F]{we both} could \[G]live \[G\didx{sus4}]      \[G]

If I was a sculptor~-- heh, but then again~-- no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do

My gift is my song, and this one's for \[C]you \[C\didx{sus4}]      \[C]

\[G/B]{And you} can tell \[Am]everybody \[Dm\hidx{7}]{this is} your \[F]song
\[G/B]{It may} be \[Am]quite simple, but~-- \[Dm]{now that} it's \[F]done
\[Am]{I hope} you don't mind, \[Am/G]{I hope} you don't mind
\[Am/F\shrp{}]{That I put} down in \[F]words
How \[C]wonderful \[Dm\hidx{7}]{life is} while \[F]you're in the \[G]world \[G\didx{sus4}]      \[G]

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
