When they said~-- who won the war
You were in the war
When they said to choose a side
It made you want to hide
When you fell in with the rest
We were not impressed
When they said~-- who won the war
It made you smile

When they told you either way
Put your past away
When they said to choose a side
It made you want to hide
When you fell in with the worst
It could be a first
When they said to choose a side
It made you smile

\[D]This \[G]time, this \[Hm]time~-- it's \[A]all the \[D]same
