\num
I'd \[Em]rather be a sparrow than a \[G]snail, yes, I would
If I could, I surely \[Em]would
I'd rather be a hammer than a \[G]nail, yes, I would
If I only could, I surely \[Em]would
A\[C]way, I'd rather sail away
Like a \[G]swan that's here and gone
A \[C]man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the \[G]world its saddest sound, its saddest \[Em]sound

I'd rather be a forest than a street, yes, I would
If I could, I surely would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet, yes, I would
If I only could, I surely would
