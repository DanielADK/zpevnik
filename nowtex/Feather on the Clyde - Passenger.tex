\[C]There's a river that runs through Glas\[G]gow
And it \[Em]makes her but it breaks her and \[C]takes her in two \[G]parts
\[C]{  And} her current just \[D\didx{add11no5}]{like my blood} \[Em]flows  \[G]
Down from the \[C]hills, round aching \[D\didx{add11no5}]{bones to my restless} \[G]heart

\[C]Well I would swim but the \[G]river is so \[D]wide and I'm
\[C]Scared I won't \[G]make it to the \[D]other side, well
\[C]God knows I've \[G]failed but he \[D]knows that I've \[G]tried

I long for something that's safe and warm, but
All I have is all that is gone
I'm as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

On one side all the lights glow
And the folks know where the kids go
when the music and the drinking starts
On the other side where no cars go
Up to the hills that stand alone like my restless heart

The sun sets late in Glasgow
And the daylight and the city part
I think of you in Glasgow
'Cause you're all that's safe, you're all that's warm
in my restless heart
