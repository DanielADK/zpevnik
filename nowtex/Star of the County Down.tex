\beginsong{Star of the County Down}[by={Irská lidová (verze Irish Rovers)}]
\num
\[D]Near \[Em]Banbridge Town in the \[G]County \[D]Down
One \[G]morning in \[Em]last Ju\[D]ly
Down a \[Em]boreen green came a \[G]sweet col\[D]leen
And she \[G]smiled as she \[Hm]passed me \[Em]by
She \[G]looked so sweet, from her \[D]two bare feet
\chordsoff
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
Such a handsome elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was staring there
\fin\chordsoff\chor
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
And from Galway to Dub-lin Town
No maid I've seen like the fair colleen
That I met in the County Down
\cl\num
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head
And I looked with a feeling rare
And I said, said I, to a passer-by
\uv{Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?}
He looked at me, and he said, said he,
\uv{She's the gem of Ireland's crown,
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the Star of the County Down.}
\fin\num
She had soft brown eyes with a look so shy
And a smile like the rose in June
And she sang so sweet, what a lovely treat
As she lilted an Irish tune
At the Lammas dance I was in a trance
As she whirled with the lads of the town
And it broke me heart just to be apart
From the Star of the County Down
\fin\num
At the harvest fair, she'll be surely there
So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut-brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
'Till my plough is a rust-colored brown
'Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the Star of the County Down
