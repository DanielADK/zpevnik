\[G]You would not be\[C]lieve your eyes
\[F]{If ten} million fireflies

Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You think me rude but I would just stand and~-- stare

\[F]I'd like to \[C]make myself be\[G]lieve
that planet \[F]Earth \[C]turns \[Em]slow\[F]ly
Its \[F]hard to say that I'd \[C]rather stay
A\[F]wake when \[G]I'm a\[Am]sleep
\[F]'Cause everything is \[C]never as it \[D]seems

\num
'Cause id get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sockhop beneath my bed
A discoball is just hanging by a thread

\ldots{} and I fall asleep\ldots{}
\cl
\num
Leave my door open just a crack
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Why do I tire of counting sheep
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
\fin
\num
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
\fin
\chor
\ldots{} because my dreams are bursting at the seams
