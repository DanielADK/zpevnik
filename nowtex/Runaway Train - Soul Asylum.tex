Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a fire fly without the light
You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
I was a key that could use a little turnin'
\fin
\num
So I'm tired and I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't leave
One more promise I can't keep

Runaway train never going back
Runaway on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

\num
Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mysteries seem so faded
\fin
\num
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train
\fin
\bridge
Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Got a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch little insane
It's just easier than the dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
Runaway~-- but it always seems the same
