\[C		]{So I start} a revo\[Cm]lution from my \[G]bed
'Cos you \[C]said the brains I \[Cm]{had went} to my \[G]head
\[C]Step outside, the \[Cm]summertime's in \[G]bloom
\[D]Stand up beside the fireplace
\[H]Take that look from off your face
'Cos\[Em]{ you} ain't ever \[D]gonna burn my \[C]heart out \[D]

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows, if it's night or day
And please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock and roll band~-- who'll throw it all away
