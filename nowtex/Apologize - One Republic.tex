I'm holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
\fin

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new~-- yeah yeah
I loved you with the fire red-
Now it's turning blue, and you say\ldots{}
\uv{Sorry} like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
